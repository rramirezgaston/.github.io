##Python
##Converting Pennies into different denominations from largest to smallest
##Using the remainder to calculate the next denomination
##Printing a final statement of how many dollars and cents are in the amount of pennies

#Step 1: Divide the pennies into the highest possible denomintation
#Work down to the least denomination possible
#worked during class with teacher

penny = int(input('Enter number of pennies:'))
quarters = penny // 25
print(f"Quarters: {quarters}")
rem = penny % 25

dimes = rem // 10
print(f"Dimes: {dimes}")
rem = rem % 10

nickles = rem // 5
print(f"Nickles: {nickles}")
rem = rem % 5

print(f"Pennies: {rem}")

#Step 2: Convert the quantities into dollars and print money amount
#Added on my own

dollars_q = int(quarters * 0.25)  #turn quarters into dollars
quarters_rem = int(quarters % 4)  #how may quarters are not a full dollar
quarters_to_pennies = quarters_rem * 25  #turn those quarters to pennies

cents = (dimes * 10) + (nickles * 5) + quarters_to_pennies + rem

print(f"You have a total of ${dollars_q}.{cents}")

#Now that I have gone the long way to practice class concepts
#It can also be done simpler

total_dollars = penny / 100
print(f"You have a total of ${total_dollars}")
